Meeting with: Torsten, Tobias.

Discussed:
- Simplifying the model even further, and understanding each step, what can be acheived with a simple setup.

Changes to make: 
- Change Q factor instead of constant ERB ( by some % or fixed value) x
  - fixed value

Test cases:
- Symmetric single filter
- Asymmetric to the low and high freq
    - observe what is happening (is the compensation only for off frequency or no)

To Do
- [x] Change 'imparment implementation' to Q factor
- [x] Implement spectral loss
- [] Do tests with one symmetric filter
- [x] Do tests with two asymmetric filters
